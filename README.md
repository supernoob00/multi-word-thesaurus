View connections between related words as a physically-simulated, dynamic network. Over 100,000 distinct words and nearly 3 million synonyms were put into a database from the Moby Thesaurus, the largest thesaurus in English. Each link between two words means that at least one is a synonym of the other.

Once you create a graph of connected words, you can also view more information about individual words by clicking on the node, which brings up both a list of its neighbors and all its synonyms. You can also click any word on those lists to view its info. Note that there are some words that only exist as a synonym, but are not present in the thesaurus as an actual entry. Because of this, the table will show that the word has zero synonyms.
